# Anomaly Detection in Mental Health Patterns

## Kharis Therapy Platform Analytics Project

### Project Overview
Led the development of a comprehensive data analytics solution for Kharis Therapy, a pan-African mental health platform, focusing on pattern detection and real-time monitoring of patient interactions.

### Key Achievements Aligned with Data Analysis Expertise

1. Data Visualization & Reporting

  Designed interactive dashboards in PowerBI for real-time monitoring of 1000+ daily patient interactions
  Created comprehensive visualization tools for trend analysis and pattern comparison, reducing pattern recognition time by 40%
  Developed intuitive risk-level distribution displays for non-technical stakeholders

2. Data Modeling & Quality

  Designed and implemented scalable ETL pipelines processing 100,000+ historical records
  Established baseline metrics and data quality frameworks achieving 95% accuracy
  Created multi-factor detection system using statistical analysis and machine learning


3. Stakeholder Collaboration

  Worked closely with therapists and healthcare providers to translate clinical requirements into technical solutions
  Led weekly presentations to non-technical stakeholders on pattern detection findings
  Provided training sessions on dashboard usage and data interpretation


4. Analytics & Insights

  Implemented statistical pattern matching and dynamic thresholding based on historical data
  Reduced false positives by 25% through enhanced pattern visualization
  Achieved 30% faster response time to critical patterns through automated alert systems

### Technical Implementation
